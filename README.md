# Sailify

*Spotify client for Sailfish OS*

! **This project is in a every early stage.** !

[*Hutspot*](https://github.com/sailfish-spotify/hutspot) seems to be dead, is only a Spotify controller and has login issues.

*Sailify* otherwise is controller and player in one. It uses the [*librespots Rust API*](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) directly and can therefore better control the Spotify player.

A premium Spotify account is required.
